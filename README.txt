This document is used to teach you how to use CBA codes.
The code is made using keras (Spyder) and use R package (KBET), it was downloaded in its homepage.
We use three datasets: pancreas, lung and chimpanzee

Codes for the pancreas datasets are commented, so similar codes in LUNG and SPECIES are not commented.
But if you read codes with comments in PANCREAS, other codes will be easy to be understood.

ATTENTION: you need to read the script 'pancreas_main.py' firstly, understand the comments in it.

So how to use CBA?
First download datasets, and put them in the corresponding file. Then select parameters as you like, and do the training.

You will need python and R language to run them.

Moreover, if you want to use the codes on other datasets, you need to put them in the codes, select parameters, and do the training.

Thank you!
